# MovieRecommendationSystem-NLP


## 📝 Overview

Implemented two Recommendation system.
- First  Recommender recommends top ten movies based on their weighted
  score derived by their averageRating , number of votes  and their popularity.
- The Other Recommendation System works using CONTENT-BASED-FILTERING and recommends movies based on the
  user's searched content.
## 🧰 Technical Aspects

- Data Cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature Engineering.
- Data Visualization.
- Text Processing.
- The First Recommendation is a hybrid between Collaborative and content based filter and recommends
  top twenty movies based on their averageRating , number of votes  and their popularity.
- The Second Recommender is implemented by conversion of tags created by combination of different
  features in Vectors by going through countVectorizer and tfidf piplines then finding similairities
  using pairwise cosine similarity matrix.
- Dumped the required model using JobLib.
